We created an implementation of Pacman. Running the PacMan class will start the game.
The user will also have to ensure they are connected to the database, otherwise, the score
tracking will not run. The build path should also contain the mySQL driver to connect to the database
and a standard OpenJDK library (built on OpenJDK 20.0.2).

HOW TO PLAY:
Use the left-click on your mouse/trackpad to control the menus of the game.
Use the arrow keys (↑ ↓ → ←) to control Pacman's movement.
Use the space bar to pause the game.

Goal:
Collect all the pellets on the map and avoid the ghosts to pass the level!
Survive as long as you can to get a highscore!
